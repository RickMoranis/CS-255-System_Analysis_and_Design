# CS-255 System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  The DriverPass project involved designing a web-based platform for the client DriverPass that would allow its users to schedule driving lessons and track their
  progress through the course. The client had specific requirements including user authentication, lesson scheduling, progress tracking, offline data access, and
  instructor management.
  
What did you do particularly well?
 
  Based on the different requirements the client had, I would say I fulfilled all the use cases they had, and did well to address all their needs. 
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I think some areas I could have showed improvement would have been to flesh out the details of the UML designs so they covered more needs for the system as well
  as communicated the work more clearly.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I interpreted the users needs by taking a close look at the business requirements document and doing research on a similar system. I then used this information
  to create UML diagrams as well as use cases to represent the systems fucntionality. 
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  The most important step in approaching the design of the software was to try and fully understand the clients needs and requirements. Once that was understood and 
  established I used techniques like use case analysis, user story mapping, and UML diagraming to put together a comprehensive system design. In the future I would 
  use these techniques again.
